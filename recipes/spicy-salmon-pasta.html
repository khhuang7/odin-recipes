        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an easy recipe that my sister recreated after having a similar dish at a cafe, and kindly passed on to me when I had very few cooking skills to speak of. It's fresh, healthy, has plenty of flavour, and comes together very quickly.</p>

        <p>(Note that the image above includes green beans and parsley instead of arugula and jalapeños - I recommend sticking to the ingredients in this recipe for a real kick!)</p>
